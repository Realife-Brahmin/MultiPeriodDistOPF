# Project Development Context

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-09-26)

### Completed Features
- [x] tADMM formulation with PDF variable names (🔵B_t0, 🔴B̂, 🟢u_t0)
- [x] Three update functions: primal, consensus, dual
- [x] Battery actions plotting with BF vs tADMM comparison
- [x] Power balance verification plotting
- [x] tADMM convergence analysis plots
- [x] LaTeX documentation for both formulations
- [x] Load/cost curve plotting with dark yellow/dark green themes

### Key Implementation Details
- **Penalty parameter**: ρ = 5.0
- **Convergence tolerances**: eps_pri = eps_dual = 1e-3
- **Battery convention**: P_B > 0 = discharging, P_B < 0 = charging
- **Color scheme**: Dark orange (BF), Blue (tADMM), Dark green (load), Purple (SOC)

### Current Working Directory
```
admm_temporal_copper_plate.jl  # Main implementation
tex/
├── brute_force_formulation.tex   # BF mathematical formulation
├── tadmm_formulation.tex         # tADMM mathematical formulation
```

### Next Steps
- [ ] Parameter sensitivity analysis for ρ
- [ ] Scalability testing with larger T
- [ ] Integration with main MultiPeriodDistOPF framework

### Development Notes
- All plotting functions use Plots.jl with :mute theme
- SOC bounds defined as B̄ = SOC_max × E_Rated, B = SOC_min × E_Rated
- Box constraints used instead of pedantic inequality forms
- Color coding: Blue (local vars), Red (consensus), Green (duals)

### Key Files Modified Today
1. `admm_temporal_copper_plate.jl` - Complete tADMM implementation
2. `tex/tadmm_formulation.tex` - Mathematical documentation
3. `tex/brute_force_formulation.tex` - Baseline formulation

### Technical Decisions Made
- Dictionary returns from all tADMM functions for extensibility
- Separate plots for each method (not comparison plots)
- Rho value displayed in tADMM plot titles
- Load profile modularized with rated power separation
